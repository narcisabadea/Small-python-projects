1. ### Soccer Data Analysis

   The project uses [`Kaggle Dataset`](https://www.kaggle.com/) and it's analysed in `Jupyter notebook` by using `pandas`, `seaborn` and `bokeh` <br>
   The `Jupyter notebook .ipynb` file can be seen [`Here`](https://github.com/narcisabadea/Small-python-projects/blob/main/SoccerAnalysis/Soccer.ipynb)

2. ### Iris Data Analysis

   The project uses [`Sklearn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and it's analysed in `Jupyter notebook` by using `datasets`, `model_selection`, `neighbors`, `metrics` from `sklearn`, along with `joblib` <br>
   The `Jupyter notebook .ipynb` file can be seen [`Here`](https://github.com/narcisabadea/Small-python-projects/blob/main/IrisAnalysis/Iris.ipynb)

3. ### Password checker

   The project uses [`Haveibeenpwned API`](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3) which allows the list of pwned accounts (email addresses and usernames) to be quickly searched via a RESTful service. <br>
   To run the project go to the `PasswordChecker` folder and use `python3 check_my_pass.py passwordToCheck`. <br>
   It will do a request to the API and return the number of times it was found. <br>

4. ### PDF merger

   The project uses [`PyPDF2 Library`](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for manipulating PDF files. <br>
   To run the project go to the `PdfMerger` folder. <br>
   It can merge multiple PDFs or add a watermark to it.
