1. ### Converter JPG images to PNG

   The project uses [`Pillow Imaging Library`](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for manipulating images. <br>
   To run the project go to the `JpgPngPokedexConverter` folder and use `python3 JpgPngPokedexConverter.py`. <br>
   It will loop through the imagines from the `Pokedex` folder, convert them to PNG format and save them to a `New` folder.

2. ### Password checker

   The project uses [`Haveibeenpwned API`](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3) which allows the list of pwned accounts (email addresses and usernames) to be quickly searched via a RESTful service. <br>
   To run the project go to the `PasswordChecker` folder and use `python3 check_my_pass.py passwordToCheck`. <br>
   It will do a request to the API and return the number of times it was found. <br>

3. ### PDF merger

   The project uses [`PyPDF2 Library`](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for manipulating PDF files. <br>
   To run the project go to the `PdfMerger` folder. <br>
   It can merge multiple PDFs or add a watermark to it.

7. ### Web scrapping

The project uses [`BeautifulSoup Library`](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. <br>
To run the project go to the `WebScrapping` folder. <br>
It will do a request to the `https://news.ycombinator.com/news`.

9. ### Soccer Data Analysis

   The project uses [`Kaggle Dataset`](https://www.kaggle.com/) and it's analysed in `Jupyter notebook` by using `pandas`, `seaborn` and `bokeh` <br>
   The `Jupyter notebook .ipynb` file can be seen [`Here`](https://github.com/narcisabadea/Small-python-projects/blob/main/SoccerAnalysis/Soccer.ipynb)

10. ### Iris Data Analysis

   The project uses [`Sklearn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and it's analysed in `Jupyter notebook` by using `datasets`, `model_selection`, `neighbors`, `metrics` from `sklearn`, along with `joblib` <br>
   The `Jupyter notebook .ipynb` file can be seen [`Here`](https://github.com/narcisabadea/Small-python-projects/blob/main/IrisAnalysis/Iris.ipynb)
