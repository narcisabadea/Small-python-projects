# Small Python projects

Some simple projects created using `Python3`.

## Converter JPG images to PNG

The project uses [`Pillow Imaging Library`](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for manipulating images. <br>

To run the project go to the `JpgPngPokedexConverter` folder and use `python3 JpgPngPokedexConverter.py`. <br>

It will loop through the imagines from the `Pokedex` folder, convert them to PNG format and save them to a `New` folder.

## Password checked

The project uses [`Haveibeenpwned API`](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3) which allows the list of pwned accounts (email addresses and usernames) to be quickly searched via a RESTful service. <br>

To run the project go to the `PasswordChecker` folder and use `python3 check_my_pass.py passwordToCheck`. <br>

It will do a request to the API and return the number of times it was found. <br>
