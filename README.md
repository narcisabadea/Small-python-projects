1. ### Converter JPG images to PNG

    The project uses [`Pillow Imaging Library`](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for manipulating images. <br>
    To run the project go to the `JpgPngPokedexConverter` folder and use `python3 JpgPngPokedexConverter.py`. <br>
    It will loop through the imagines from the `Pokedex` folder, convert them to PNG format and save them to a `New` folder.

2. ### Password checker

    The project uses [`Haveibeenpwned API`](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3) which allows the list of pwned accounts (email addresses and usernames) to be quickly searched via a RESTful service. <br>
    To run the project go to the `PasswordChecker` folder and use `python3 check_my_pass.py passwordToCheck`. <br>
    It will do a request to the API and return the number of times it was found. <br>

3. ### PDF merger

    The project uses [`PyPDF2 Library`](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for manipulating PDF files. <br>
    To run the project go to the `PdfMerger` folder. <br>

4. ### Really smart brain

    The project uses [`ImageAI Library`](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI) which supports a list of state-of-the-art Machine Learning algorithms for image prediction, custom image prediction, object detection, video detection, video object tracking and image predictions trainings <br>
    To run the project go to the `ReallySmartBrain` folder. <br>
